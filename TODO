calcZscores:
(wh 8.5.2007)
==============
Three options for calculation of the denominator in the calcZscores() function:
(i) screenwide (currently, this is the only option)
(ii) separately for each plate
(iii) separately for each batch of plates
Wh thinks that (iii) should be the default.


normalizeChannels:
(wh 11.5.2007)
==================
This function should be reversed to the behaviour it had before May
2007, in order to avoid frustration with users that have been using
it. However, it should be deprecated (i.e. give a deprecation 
warning and a suggestion to use a new function "summarizeChannels").
This new function "summarizeChannels" should do what normalizeChannels
do now. The threshold "0.7" should not be default. Users should be
forced to think about it and set it themselves.

 
per experiment quality report:
(wh 14.5.2007)
==============================
Should also report a measure of reproducibility when there are >2 
replicates. Are there any n-dimensional generalisations of the 
Spearman rank correlation? Perhaps sth like the size of the 
residuals of a linear regression of the ranked values.

writeReport is much too slow. We need to find the time suckers and make 
it more efficient.
 

configure
(wh 14.5.2007)
==============================
Should take a "path" argument, similar as readPlateData

export 
(wh 14.5.2007)
==============================
There should be a simple option to export complete cellHTS objects
to Spotfire; details of how to do this need to be worked together with
Spotfire users in MB's lab.

S4
(wh 14.5.2007)
==============================
cellHTS class should be made S4. On the long run, this will make our
code easier to maintain and less breakable.
