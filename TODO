In have tried to order them roughly in order of importance & feasibility:


normalizeChannels:
(wh 11.5.2007)
==================
This function should be reversed to the behaviour it had before May
2007, in order to avoid frustration with users that have been using
it. However, it should be deprecated (i.e. give a deprecation 
warning and a suggestion to use a new function "summarizeChannels").
This new function "summarizeChannels" should do what normalizeChannels
do now. The threshold "0.7" should not be default. Users should be
forced to think about it and set it themselves.

 
configure
(wh 14.5.2007)
==============================
Should take a "path" argument, similar as readPlateData


calcZscores:
(wh 8.5.2007)
==============
Three options for calculation of the denominator in the calcZscores() function:
(i) screenwide (currently, this is the only option)
(ii) separately for each plate
(iii) separately for each batch of plates
Wh thinks that (iii) should be the default.


per experiment quality report:
(wh 14.5.2007)
==============================
Should also report a measure of reproducibility when there are >2 
replicates. Are there any n-dimensional generalisations of the 
Spearman rank correlation? Perhaps sth like the size of the 
residuals of a linear regression of the ranked values.

Histogrammes of intensities could have rugs at the bottom in different
colours indicating the values of the controls.


S4
(wh 14.5.2007)
==============================
cellHTS class should be made S4. On the long run, this will make our
code easier to maintain and less breakable.


writeReport
(wh 14.5.2007)
==============
writeReport is much too slow. We need to find the time suckers and make 
it more efficient. The progress report gives numbers that are
misleading (e.g. people have complained that it gets stuck forever at "99%").
 
The screenview currently contains hyperlinks to the gene
annotations. It would also be nice to show the underlying raw data
values. However, not sure whether HTML image map is the right thing to
do, are there more efficient ways? Is there a free alternative to
Spotfire? Ggobi?


export 
(wh 14.5.2007)
==============================
There should be a simple option to export complete cellHTS objects
to Spotfire; details of how to do this need to be worked together with
Spotfire users in MB's lab.


Standalone .exe with GUI
(wh 21.5.2007)
==============================
explore whether it is possible to provide a standalone product (e.g.
an .exe file or a CD) that allows Windows users to run a basic
analysis in cellHTS through a GUI without installation or seeing 
the commandline. This is not intended to replace the programmatic
version; it is intended as a "gateway drug" or for teaching. Need to
discuss with Robert the technical aspects, but it should be possible 
without major programming, just putting together existing tools.
