calcZscores:
(wh 8.5.2007)
==============
Three options for calculation of the denominator in the calcZscores() function:
(i) screenwide (currently, this is the only option)
(ii) separately for each plate
(iii) separately for each batch of plates
Wh thinks that (iii) should be the default.


normalizeChannels:
(wh 11.5.2007)
==================
This function should be reversed to the behaviour it had before May
2007, in order to avoid frustration with users that have been using
it. However, it should be deprecated (i.e. give a deprecation 
warning and a suggestion to use a new function "summarizeChannels").
This new function "summarizeChannels" should do what normalizeChannels
do now. The threshold "0.7" should not be default. Users should be
forced to think about it and set it themselves.
