## Given as input an array (e.g. x$xraw, or x$xnorm) with dimensions wells x plates x replicates x channels, this function creates a matrix with the data of eacg replicate of a chosen "channel" in columns. By default, the dimension of the output matrix is (wells*plates) x replicates, and the first channel of 'y' is considered.
## if 'na.rm' is set to TRUE, the rows with at least one entry missing are removed, so that the output matrix have no missing entries.

getMatrix = function(y, channel=1, na.rm=FALSE) {
 ## Check if the input:
 if(!is(y, "array") | length(dim(y))!=4)
   stop("'y' must be an array with four dimensions, such as x$xraw or x$xnorm") 

 if (channel > dim(y)[4])
   stop(sprintf("'channel' can only take the value(s) %s \n indicating which of the channels of 'y' should be considered", paste(1:dim(y)[4], collapse=", ")))

 
nrep = dim(y)[3]
xmat = matrix(y[,,,channel], nrow=prod(dim(y)[1:2]), ncol=nrep)
if (na.rm) {
  rem = rowSums(is.na(xmat))>0
  xmat = xmat[!rem,] }
return(xmat)}
